## Encrypted chat project

This project is a secure, two-part chat application built with Node.js. It includes:

- **encrypted-chat-client** – a WebSocket-based chat interface
- **encrypted-chat-api** – a REST API that generates secret keys and handles basic data logic

### Project Structure

```
encrypted-chat-project/
├── encrypted-chat-client/   # Frontend + WebSocket chat server
└── encrypted-chat-api/      # REST API + SQLite database
```

---

### How to Run

#### 1. Run the REST API (in a separate terminal)

```bash
cd encrypted-chat-api
npm install
node server.js
```

The API will start and generate secret keys on request. When a user clicks "send", the message is also securely saved into the database.

#### 2. Run the WebSocket chat client

```bash
cd ../encrypted-chat-client
npm install
node index.js
```

You can then access the chat app via `http://localhost:PORT`.

### Security

- Secret keys are generated by the REST API and used in the chat client for secure communication.
- The app architecture separates concerns between key management (API) and real-time messaging (WebSocket).
